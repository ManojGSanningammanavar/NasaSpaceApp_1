🚀 Overview

“Will It Rain On My Parade?” is an AI-powered weather intelligence and event planning application that leverages NASA’s Earth observation data to provide highly accurate, location-specific weather forecasts. Designed for individuals, communities, and event organizers, the project helps users make informed decisions about outdoor activities by predicting the likelihood of rain, extreme heat, cold, wind, or general discomfort during a specific date and location.

Our goal is to make space-based weather data accessible and actionable, turning complex satellite insights into simple, personalized weather guidance that anyone can use to plan their day confidently.

🛰️ How It Works

The system integrates multiple NASA open datasets, including:

Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) – for rainfall and precipitation patterns

MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) – for cloud cover and surface temperature

AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) – for humidity and air temperature

MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications) – for wind and atmospheric conditions

Using these datasets, our backend employs machine learning models that:

Analyze historical and real-time satellite data

Identify environmental patterns related to weather anomalies

Predict the probability of “very hot,” “very cold,” “very windy,” “very wet,” or “very uncomfortable” conditions

Visualize risk levels on an interactive map-based dashboard

💡 Core Features

🌧️ Rain Prediction Engine: Predicts rainfall probability and duration using satellite precipitation data

🧠 AI Insights: Personalized comfort index based on user activity, date, and location

🗺️ Interactive Weather Map: Displays real-time and forecast data from NASA APIs

📱 Smart Event Planner: Provides suggestions like rescheduling times or alternative safe locations

🔔 Custom Alerts: Notifies users of weather risks that could affect outdoor events

🎯 Impact and Goals

This project aims to:

Empower communities and event organizers to make data-driven weather decisions

Demonstrate the practical applications of NASA’s Earth Science data
Promote climate awareness by visualizing real-time atmospheric data
Enhance public preparedness and safety for outdoor events
By turning satellite observations into intuitive insights, “Will It Rain On My Parade?” helps bridge the gap between space data and everyday human experiences—making weather intelligence more predictive, personal, and proactive.
